# 🐾 PAWSIGHT – AI-Based Animal Triage System

An AI-powered decision-support system designed to assist in prioritizing and assessing the severity of stray animal incidents using machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

PAWSIGHT is a machine learning application that:
- Classifies animal incidents into priority levels (P1–P3)
- Predicts a continuous severity score (0–100)
- Provides a web-based interface for real-time testing
- Uses interpretable ML models suitable for real-world deployment

This project was developed for academic purposes to demonstrate an end-to-end ML pipeline.
